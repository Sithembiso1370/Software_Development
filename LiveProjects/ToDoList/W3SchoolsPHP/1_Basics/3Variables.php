// PHP is a Loosely Typed Language
// In the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.

// PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.

// In PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives an option to specify the data type expected when declaring a function, and by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a "Fatal Error" on a type mismatch.

// You will learn more about strict and non-strict requirements, and data type declarations in the PHP Functions chapter.
