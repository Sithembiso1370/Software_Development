   <!-- CSS Transitions
       
    <h4>CSS transitions provide a way to control how a property changes from one value to
    the next over time. We can make the property value change gradually, creating pleas
    ant
    and, hopefully, unobtrusive effects.</h4>
    <h4 ><i>In this chapter, we cover the four transition properties and the transition shorthand
        that not only make our transition possible but very easy to implement.</i></h4>

        <div class="div1" id="div1">
           NB | When the user hovers over the div, every property that has a different value in the
           default state versus the hovered state will change to the hover-state values. We use the
           transition-property property to define which of those properties we want to animate
           over time (versus instantly). All the properties will change from the default
           value to the hovered value on hover, but only the animatable properties included in
           the transition-property will transition over time. Nonanimatable properties like
           border-style will change from one value to the next instantly.
        </div>

        <div class="divalltrans" id="divalltrans">
                        all
            If you want to define all the properties to transition at the same time, speed, and pace,
            use all. If all is the only value or the last value in the comma-separated value for
            transition-property, all the animatable properties will transition in unison.
        </div>

        <div class="foo">Hello</div> -->

        <!-- CSS ANIMATIONS -->
        <!-- @keyframes -->
        <div class="defintionAnimations">
            CSS animations are similar to transitions in that values of CSS properties change over
            time. But transitions only let us animate from an initial value to a destination value
            and back again. CSS keyframe animations let us decide if and how an animation
            repeats and give us granular control over what happens throughout the animation.

        console.log('My event | ',e);
        console.log('My event target parent| ',e.target.parentNode);
