            CSS Selectors
            CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

            We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

            Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
            This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.
