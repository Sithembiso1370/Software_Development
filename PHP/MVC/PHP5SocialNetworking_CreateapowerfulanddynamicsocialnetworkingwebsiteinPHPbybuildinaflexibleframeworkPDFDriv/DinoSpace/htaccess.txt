Let's go through this file, line by line.
1. First, we tell Apache that the index.php file should deal with any 404 errors
(file not found).
2. The index.php file is the default file in the directory, so if someone visits the
folder on the web server with our site in, and doesn't specify a file, index.
php is called automatically.
3. The IfModule block is conditional: the rules only apply if the module
mod_rewrite is installed.
4. If it is installed, we enable the rewrite engine.
5. If the user is trying to request a file, don't follow the rewrite rule (without
this, uploaded files and images wouldn't be displayed as even these requests
would be routed through our index.php file).
6. If the user is trying to access a directory that exists, then the rule isn't
followed again.
7. Finally, we have the rewrite rule, which takes the users request, and
interoperates it as the page $_GET parameter for our index.php file to
process. The rule takes everything from the URL (apart from the domain,
and any folders our site may be stored within) and appends it to the page get
variable. This line also takes any user-specified query strings (for example,
&somefield=somevalue) and appends it to the URL (QSA), and then ignores
other rules if that rule was used (L).
