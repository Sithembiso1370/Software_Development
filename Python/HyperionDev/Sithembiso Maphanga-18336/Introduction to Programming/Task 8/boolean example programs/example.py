# *** NOTE ON COMMENTS ***
# This is a comment in Python. 
# Comments can be placed anywhere in Python code and the computer ignores them -- they are intended to be read by humans. 
# Any line with a # in front of it is a comment.
# Please read all the comments in this example file and all others.


# ========= Declaring Boolean Variables  =========
# Boolean variables are declared like any other type of variable

# ************ Example 1 ************

hasDriversLicence = True 
hasTrafficFine = False

# Please note when assigning either True or False to a variable don't forget to capitalise the first letter.
# Python is case sensitive which means, true, True and TRUE, mean three diffrent things!


# ========= Booleans in if Statements =========
# The if statement is an example of a control statement. 
# A control statement is a statement that determines whether or not other statements will be executed.
# The if statement contains a condition that evaluates to either True or False which is a Boolean value.
# This determines whether or not the indented statements will be executed. 


# ************ Example 2 ************

print("Example 2: ")

isSunny = True

if isSunny:
    print ("It is sunny today, don't forget the sunscreen!")
    
#Explanation:
# Since isSunny is True the print statement will execute and print out "It is sunny today, don't forget the sunscreen!‚Äù
# If isSunny is changed to False the print statement will not execute and nothing will be printed.
