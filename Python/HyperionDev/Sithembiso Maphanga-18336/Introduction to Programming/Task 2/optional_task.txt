c) Optional Bonus Task
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers beginning with 0 and 1, in
which every number after the first two can be found by adding the two
numbers before it. For example, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
are as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …
● Create a new text file called optional_task.txt inside this folder.
● Inside the optional_task.txt file write the pseudocode for the algorithm
that asks the user for a number and stores that number in a variable
called n. Then the algorithm should calculate and print out the first n
numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

SOLUTION:
{
    [ Background
            Fibonacci to get any value
            where F is the nth fibbonacci number
            n is the position of the number within the sequence 
            F(n) = F(n-1)+ F(n-2)
            F(0) = 0
    ]
    -----------------------------------------
    Actual Pseudo Code Solution |

    Request number from user 
    Store number in variable called n
    while n is greater or equal to 0
        Store each fibbonacci number at (F(n-1)+ F(n-2)) in an array
        Decrement the value of n by 1   
    Print the array containing Fibonacci numbers in reverse so it starts from smallest to biggest.
