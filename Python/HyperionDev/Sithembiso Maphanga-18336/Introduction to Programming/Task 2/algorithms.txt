a) An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
World”.

SOLUTION:
{
    Request  user to input their name
    Store the input in a variable called first_name
    Print first_name combined with the string “Hello,World”. or (first_name + “Hello,World”)
}

b) An algorithm that asks a user to enter their age and then stores
their age in a variable called age. Subsequently, the algorithm
should print out “You’re old enough” if the user’s age is over or
equal to 18, or print out “Almost there” if the age is equal to or over
16, but less than 18. Finally, the algorithm should print out “You’re
just too young” if the user is younger than (and not equal to) 16.

SOLUTION:
{
    Request age input from user
    Store  age input into variable age
    If user’s age is over or equal to 18
        Print “You’re old enough”
    Else if the age is equal to or over 16, but less than 18
        Print “Almost there”
    Else 
        Print “You’rejust too young”
}
