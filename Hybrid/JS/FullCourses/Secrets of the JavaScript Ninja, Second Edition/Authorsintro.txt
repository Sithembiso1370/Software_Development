It’s incredible to think of how much the world of JavaScript has changed since I first
started writing Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja back in 2008. The world in which we write
JavaScript now, while still being largely centered around the browser, is nearly
unrecognizable.
The popularity of JavaScript as a full-featured, cross-platform language has
exploded. Node.js is a formidable platform against which countless production applications
are developed. Developers are actually writing applications in one language—
JavaScript—that are capable of running in a browser, on a server, and even in a native
app on a mobile device.
It’s more important now, than ever before, that a developer’s knowledge of the
JavaScript language be at its absolute peak. Having a fundamental understanding of
the language and the ways in which it can be best written will allow you to create applications
that can work on virtually any platform, which is a claim that few other languages
can legitimately boast.
Unlike previous eras in the growth of JavaScript, there hasn’t been equal growth in
platform incompatibilities. It used to be that you would salivate over the thought of
using the most basic new browser features and yet be stymied by outdated browsers that
had far too much market share. We’ve entered a harmonious time in which most users
are on rapidly updated browsers that compete to be the most standards-compliant
platform around. Browser vendors even go out of their way to develop features
specifically targeted at developers, hoping to make their lives easier.
